### Error lens

[**Error Lens**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=usernamehw.errorlens) changes the way you interact with Errors on VS Code. Instead of having to stare at the "Problems" Pane in VS Code anytime you need to identify a error/warning and where it resides, Error Lens lets you see the culprits directly in the respective lines in your code where the error/warning was raised. It offers distinctive coloring for Errors and Warnings and allows you to read the reason for the Error/Warning in the same line.

Here's an example of an error in some Python code:
